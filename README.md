## Roles/Contributions	
Each group member contributed to various elements of the project. This differed from what we initially planned in our Project Proposal. As we each picked up tasks, we took on responsibilities for different elements of the project.

### Team Roles
#### _Bradley:_
* Brad did this

#### _Cecilia:_
* Cece did that

#### _George:_
* George is the coolest

#### _Sophie:_
* Sophie did things too

### Communication/Interactions
* Each week in our weekly COMP3120 workshop, our group would work together to decide what each member would work on for the week. This was also a time where we could assist each other with any errors we had come across, or discuss ideas for the project.
* We used Facebook Messenger to communicate throughout the project and to suggest ideas and improvement.
* We utilised pull requests in [GitHub](https://github.com/MQCOMP3120-2020/group-project-group-z) so any new functionality is reviewed by another group member before that code is merged into the master branch. This also helped with testing functionality so we didn't introduce too much bugs.
* A [Google Sheets Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DTJB87OywgLXMo6mj35LikxVFykVOYqeornXXZ_rcb8/edit?usp=sharing) was used to keep track of what tasks members were responsible for that week. It included a section called "small tasks", so any members who had extra time in the week could pick up smaller tasks to implement into the project. This worked well, because if anyone had any new ideas, they could add it into the smaller tasks section for later. This also helped us keep track of bugs.
